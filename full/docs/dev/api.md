# API

This project uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

Static files can be added to `full/static` and will be passed through the `/static/` endpoint.

## Docker

The Celery images are based off of the [Multi-Py CelUvicornery Project](https://github.com/multi-py/python-uvicorn) and work for ARM and AMD out of the box.
