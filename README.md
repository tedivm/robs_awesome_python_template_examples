# Awesome Python Template's Awesome Examples

This repository is made up of examples from the [awesome python template](https://github.com/tedivm/tedivms_awesome_python_template).


- [Basic Library](./library)- enables basic library features without the full scale applications.
- [All Options Enabled](./full)- includes every option and service.
- [All Options Disabled](./bare)- disabled every optional service for an extremely basic scaffold.

These are just some options, as features can be mixed and matched to create numerous permutations.
